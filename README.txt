*** Introduction

Jan 2013: soon to be converted to a Gradle build
 
Easter's Eggs. 

This does not refer to the secret-codes/tricks in video games! 

Define an 'egg' to be a foothold example that helps you understand, or grow, some Hibernate.

I like to keep examples/eggs around for reference, and wanted to share with the world. 

*** Requirements

-- assumes Java 5+ is available

*** Ant

-- type 'ant help' to get the order of targets. 

For example:

1. clean        cleans all class files
2. compile      compiles Java
3. gen_ddl      generate ddl sql
4. build_db     creates database tables
5. populate_db  populates the database (use ~/sql/populate.sql)
6. run          runs the Java main class (see ServerImpl.java)
